## about

This site provides a digitized, searchable record of the flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's personal plane (sometimes called the "Lolita Express").

### Where does the data come from?

The original PDF source for the data comes from documents revealed during two court cases:

- _**Epstein v. Edwards**_: In 2009, [Jeffrey Epstein](/passenger/jeffrey-epstein) sued Bradley J. Edwards, a lawyer representing three women who claimed they had been sexually assaulted by Epstein. As part of the case, logs from Epstein's plane were entered into evidence. The logs were [first reported on by the website Gawker](https://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971). These documents are [available on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html).

- _**Giuffre v. Maxwell**_: In 2015, [Virginia Roberts Guiffre](/passenger/virginia-roberts-giuffre) filed a suit against [Ghislane Maxwell](/passenger/ghislane-maxwell) for defamation. As part of the case, even more flight logs (some overlapping with the above case) were entered into evidence. Efforts to digitize this set of records are still ongoing. The original documents are available [on DocumentCloud](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471/Epstein-Docs.pdf).

### Why are some entries "not linked to an identified passenger"?

The original flight logs used a pattern of referring to some passengers by their initials, especially if they flew frequently. In some cases it was not possible to determine who a set of initials is supposed to indicate. Misspellings and numerous illegible names also exist. For this reason, passengers are reviewed manually by the administrators. Unreviewed passengers will appear in light grey on flight detail pages, and will not have a linkable passenger page.
