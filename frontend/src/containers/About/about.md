## about

This site provides a digitized, searchable record of the so-called "Epstein Flight Logs".

### Where does the data come from?

The original PDF source for the data comes from documents revealed during two court cases:

- _Epstein v. Edwards_: In 2009, Jeffrey Epstein sued Bradley J. Edwards, a lawyer representing three women who claimed they had been sexually assaulted by Epstein. As part of the case, logs from Epstein's plane were entered into evidence. The logs were [first reported on by the website Gawker](https://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971). These documents are [available on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html).
