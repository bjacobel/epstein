Records pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein, digitized, cleaned and made available in several useful formats.

## manifests
Flight logs from Epstein's personal planes and helicopters.

### `Epstein-v-Edwards.pdf`
The "original" logs as presented in Epstein v. Edwards, obtained by [Gawker.com](https://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971) in 2015 and downloaded from [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html).

### `Giuffre-v-Maxwell-bw.pdf`
A subset of the trove of documents (Exhibit BB) unsealed as part of the defamation suit against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2019. Downloaded from [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html). Some overlap with above. Converted from original color to B/W because the big color one was too large for GitHub, but the original is [available on S3](https://files.bjacobel.com/Giuffre-v-Maxwell.pdf).

### `parsed.csv`
The result of performing OCR on the above PDFs, then parsing the rows into a CSV and eliminating duplication. A manual pass was done for error correction. This work builds off previous digitization efforts by some lovely Anonymous, Pizzagate and QAnon people.
